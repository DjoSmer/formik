</h3>

## Fork changes

### After changing a field, other fields aren't re-render.
Work only `<Formik children/>` as `ReactNode`. If you use `<Formik component/>` or `<Formik children/>` as function, formik run re-render after any change filed.

Formik - https://codesandbox.io/s/formik-rerender-test-v8gw7x <br/>
Formik2nd - https://codesandbox.io/s/formik2nd-rerender-test-forked-mlwvqr 

### Support React 16, 17, 18
### New hook [useFormikSelector](/docs/api/useFormikSelector.md)
### FormikState move to FormikProps.state
`FormikState` used to be included in FormikProps. Now FormikState is in the `state` properties of `FormikProps`.
### FormikProps.dirty => FormikProps.isDirty()
### FormikProps.isValid => FormikProps.isValid()
### FastFiled === Field
Difference between `FastField` and `Field`, `FastField` is only re-render after formik state change by its name.

### FieldArray, methods pop, remove, unshift return Promise
